# Bumper Balls

### Before Opening Code

Before starting to work on changes, you should pull pending changes to the repo.

`git pull`

### Saving Code

When trying to save your changes, you should run the following commands:

`git add (files you have modified)`

`git commit -m "(Commit message describing what you have done)"`

`git push -u origin master`

It should then prompt you for a username and password. Enter those, and your changes will be saved to the git repository.
